**Live Demo:** [https://realmind-base.dailywiser.xyz/](https://realmind-base.dailywiser.xyz/)

## What We Do

**RealMind is a play-to-learn onchain quiz platform where users earn crypto rewards for mastering blockchain concepts.**

We've created a Duolingo-style learning experience for Web3, where users:
- Pay a small entry fee to start quiz games
- Answer questions about Web3, DeFi, and blockchain fundamentals
- Earn in tokens based on quiz performance
- Compete on global leaderboards for seasonal rewards
- Track their learning progress with XP points

## Unique Value Proposition

**What Makes RealMind Different:**

Unlike quest platforms (Layer3, Galxe, RabbitHole, Zealy) that focus on task completion for airdrops, RealMind is a **knowledge-based learning platform** where users must genuinely understand concepts to earn rewards.

### Key Differentiators:

1. **Educational Depth over Task Completion**
   - Quest platforms: Simple social tasks (follow, retweet, join Discord)
   - **RealMind**: Comprehensive quizzes requiring actual blockchain knowledge
   - Users must demonstrate understanding, not just complete checkboxes

2. **Immediate Financial Rewards**
   - Quest platforms: Future airdrops with uncertain value
   - **RealMind**: token payouts upon season end
   - Transparent, smart contract-based reward calculation

3. **Onchain Learning Verification**
   - All quiz sessions are recorded on-chain with permanent proof of knowledge
   - Performance metrics tracked via smart contracts
   - Creates a verifiable learning credential system

4. **Progressive Learning Paths**
   - Structured curriculum from Web3 basics to advanced DeFi concepts
   - Difficulty-based reward multipliers incentivize skill development
   - XP system tracks long-term learning progress

5. **Skin in the Game**
   - Pay-to-play model ensures serious learners
   - Entry fee creates commitment and filters low-quality participants
   - Higher engagement quality vs. free quest platforms

**Technical Differentiators:**
- Smart contract-based quiz session management with on-chain tracking
- Transparent, algorithmic reward distribution (no manual airdrops)
- Real-time leaderboards with seasonal competitions
- Integrated wallet support (OnchainKit, Farcaster MiniApp)
