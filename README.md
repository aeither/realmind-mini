All smart contracts are deployed on **Core Testnet2** (Chain ID: 1114) for fast, low-cost transactions.

#### **Token1.sol** - Reward Token
```solidity
// ERC-20 token for Realmind ecosystem rewards
contract Token1 is ERC20 {
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedMinters;
    
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(authorizedMinters[msg.sender], "Not authorized");
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

#### **QuizGame.sol** - Solo Quiz System
```solidity
// On-chain quiz management with instant rewards
contract QuizGame {
    mapping(address => uint256) public userScores;
    mapping(string => Quiz) public quizzes;
    
    function startQuiz(string memory quizId, uint256 answer) external payable {
        // Entry fee validation and initial token minting
        require(msg.value >= QUIZ_ENTRY_FEE, "Insufficient entry fee");
        token.mint(msg.sender, INITIAL_REWARD);
    }
    
    function completeQuiz(uint256 finalAnswer) external {
        // Score validation and bonus token distribution
        uint256 bonus = calculateBonus(msg.sender, finalAnswer);
        token.mint(msg.sender, bonus);
    }
}
```

        DuelState state;
    }
    
    function startDuel(address opponent, uint256 stake) external payable {
        // Create duel with entry fees
        require(msg.value >= MIN_ENTRY_FEE, "Insufficient stake");
        duels[duelId] = Duel(msg.sender, opponent, msg.value, msg.value * 2, DuelState.Active);
    }

        Quiz storage quiz = quizzes[tokenId];
        require(msg.value >= quiz.playFee, "Insufficient payment");
        
        uint256 royaltyAmount = (msg.value * quiz.royaltyPercent) / 10000;
        (bool success, ) = quiz.creator.call{value: royaltyAmount}("");
        require(success, "Royalty payment failed");
        
        quiz.playCount++;
        quiz.totalEarnings += msg.value;
    }
    
    function royaltyInfo(uint256 tokenId, uint256 salePrice) 
        external view override returns (address, uint256) {
        // EIP-2981 royalty standard implementation
        address creator = quizzes[tokenId].creator;
